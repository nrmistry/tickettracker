# Ticket Tracker Project

This project used React TypeScript to create a web app that counts employees tickets. The basis of the project was to sucessfully use useState to incorparate a count function to keep track of an array of employees completed tickets. I have also added a search by name and role function to make it easier to search for whichever employee required. I have incorparate styling to make it accessible on phone screen and web page.
